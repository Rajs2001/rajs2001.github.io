<h3>Sardar Bhagat Singh</h3> 				
<p>Sardar Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary socialist who played a significant role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. He was born on September 28, 1907, in a village in present-day Punjab, India.<br><br>

Bhagat Singh was a fierce and vocal critic of British colonial rule and the oppressive policies of the British government. He was instrumental in organizing several revolutionary movements, including the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, which aimed to overthrow the British government in India.<br><br>

Bhagat Singh was known for his bold and fearless approach to political activism, and he was willing to sacrifice his life for the cause of Indian independence. He was arrested and imprisoned several times for his revolutionary activities, and he eventually became a martyr when he was hanged by the British government on March 23, 1931, at the young age of 23.<br><br>

Today, Bhagat Singh is widely regarded as a national hero in India, and his life and legacy continue to inspire people around the world who fight against injustice and oppression.

<h3>Mahatma Gandhi</h3> 				
<p>Mahatma Gandhi was a prominent political and spiritual leader in India who played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India.<br><br>

Gandhi was a staunch advocate of non-violent civil disobedience as a means to achieve social and political change. He led several mass movements, including the Salt Satyagraha and the Quit India movement, which played a significant role in India's independence struggle. Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha, or the power of truth and non-violence, influenced several other notable leaders around the world, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.<br><br>

In addition to his political activism, Gandhi was also a prolific writer and a strong advocate for social justice and human rights. He wrote extensively on topics such as religion, morality, and the importance of self-discipline and self-control. His autobiography, "The Story of My Experiments with Truth," is considered a classic in Indian literature.<br><br>

Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a Hindu nationalist who opposed his views on interfaith harmony and his advocacy for the rights of India's Muslim minority. However, his legacy continues to inspire people around the world to this day.</p>
